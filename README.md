# Faq
Q1: You don't know how to write YARA rules?
> Check out [aweasome-yara](https://github.com/InQuest/awesome-yara), this repository contains list of YARA rules collections which you can use. Didn't found what you were looking for? Try creating own YARA rules, take a look at [YARA documentation](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

Q2: We recommend using https://console.groq.com instead of self hosted OLLAMA for better performance!
> We will also underline that https://console.groq.com offers very nice and kind Free Tier which should be enough for small or medium size deployments of Novel
